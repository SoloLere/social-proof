## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Had to go do a quick flexbox box course for the project

- width and flex-shrink are really good combos because shrink direspects width until width is reached and shrink now gets disrespected.

-when going from flex column to row, one item will always try to smotch the rest, the best way to overcome this is by giving the flex items a defined width.

-flex basis behaves like width in row layout and height in column layout. It looks at the main axis of the parent

- Flex sets the outside to a display of block and flexes the inside. 

- Display: inline-flex, mess around with it a bit. THis property sets the container as an inline element

### Useful resources

- [resource 1](https://courses.kevinpowell.co/conquering-responsive-layouts) - This  Kevin's course on flexbos really helped me discover the awsome power of flex. I really enjoyed learing about flex and will use it going forward.
